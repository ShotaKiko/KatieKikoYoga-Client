            My work as a elementary teacher has lead me to become quite the
            storyteller but my love for true healing of the mind, body and soul
            is what continues to drive and motivate my yoga teachings. I have
            been doing yoga for the past 16 years as a way for myself to maintain <span>balance </span>
            and meditate upon my <span>inner peace</span>.
